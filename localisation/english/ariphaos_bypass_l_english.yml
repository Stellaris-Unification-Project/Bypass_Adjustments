 ariphaos_bypass_cooldown: "Gateway Transit Lethargy"
 ariphaos_bypass.3.name: "Gateway Travel Blocked"
 ariphaos_bypass.3.desc: "A fleet attempted to move to or from a gateway in a contested system."
 ariphaos_bypass.11.name: "Hostile Gateway in Captured System"
 ariphaos_bypass.11.desc: "We have captured [FROM.solar_system.GetName], which holds a hostile gateway. We have the technology to overload the gateway, if we choose. We just need to supply enough energy, and hold the system until the dimensional cascade disrupts the structure."
 ariphaos_bypass.11.optA: "Proceed with the disruption."
 ariphaos_bypass.11.optB: "Negative. We have plans for this gateway."
 ariphaos_bypass.12.name: "Gateway Disruption in Progress"
 ariphaos_bypass.12.desc: "[FROM.FROM.solar_system.GetName] has been captured, and the [From.GetName] is trying to disrupt our gateway there. We must retake the system to save our gateway!"
 ariphaos_bypass.14.name: "Gateway Disrupted"
 ariphaos_bypass.14.desc: "We have successfully disrupted the gateway in the [FROM.FROM.FROM.FROM.solar_system.GetName] system. It is no longer connected to the network."
 ariphaos_bypass.15.name: "Gateway Disrupted"
 ariphaos_bypass.15.desc: "Our gateway in the [FROM.FROM.FROM.FROM.solar_system.GetName] system has been disabled!"
 ariphaos_bypass.16.name: "Gateway Rescued"
 ariphaos_bypass.16.desc: "We failed to maintain control of the system, the cascade wave has fizzled out and the gateway remains active."
 ariphaos_bypass.17.name: "Gateway Rescued"
 ariphaos_bypass.17.desc: "We have successfully reclaimed the system and saved our gateway!"
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_ignore_cooldown: "Trans-Subspace Cooling Systems"
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_ignore_cooldown_desc: "By venting heat directly into subspace during transition through a gateway, we can leave our exit at full acceleration."
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_ignore_cooldown_desc_small: "Ignore the speed penalty when exiting a gateway."
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_disruption: "Gateway Disruption"
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_disruption_desc: "With this technology, it is possible to overload a gateway by exploiting its own dimensional warping. Left unchecked, the resulting oscilations in the bulk will overwhelm the structure and disrupt its link to the network."
 tech_ariphaos_gateway_disruption_desc_small: "Permits cutting off gateways from the network in occupied systems."
